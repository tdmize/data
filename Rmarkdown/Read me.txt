1. Save this folder locally. I saved it on my U drive, so if you put iton your U drive you won't need to change filepaths.

2. In your .rmd file, put this above the first header...

Things to change:
- the author and date, and title. If you want a line break in the title (as I have below) put in <br> where you want the break
- If you did not sae to your U drive, change the filpaths for css and in the includes: section.
